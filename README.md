# README #

A demo web application powered by Firebase (DB + Cloud Functions), React, Node, and Stripe.

A website on which one can select pictures they wish printed on a canvas. Check out the demo at: https://tilesbyjoe.firebaseapp.com.

To test fake orders you can use the [Stripe Sandbox Credit Card Number](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#use-test-cards)

A backend for administrators to print the orders also exists at: https://tilesbyjoe.firebaseapp.com/admin. For now, it's password-locked but I'll remove it for the purpose of this demo.
